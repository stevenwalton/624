If pop did not copy one value from the current heap it would
undo both assignments. EG:
x := 1;
y := 2;
x := 3;
y := 4;
popheap x

results with {x=1,y=2}

By copying one value we can retain more information than if we did not.
This allows us to have more functionality in our code and
to actually do something with our new updated value.
