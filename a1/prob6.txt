Iterator returns a boolean like value, which is Nomore or More. Meaning that 
either you have gotten to the end of the tree (Nomore) or you have not (More).
It first goes down the right side of the tree and then the left, transversing
it once. Because it does this, iter could be used in a function telling it to 
continue or not.
