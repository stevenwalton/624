Iter returns a pair that contains the first integer of the tree and then 
a iter function. It does not evaluate until used in a function. When it does,
it traverses the left side first, and then the right side. Once evaluated the 
par would look something like More(integer,More(integer,...(Nomore)). This can
be used to gather entries on nodes of the tree without traversing the tree
more than once. This is because it is performing lazy evaluation, and while our
final pair may look like above our first step looks like More(integer, function), 
where function would again call the iter with the new subtree.
